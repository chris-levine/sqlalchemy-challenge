# sqlalchemy-challenge
#### This is my submission for the sqlalchemy challenge. The goal of this assignment was to be able to make queries using sql alchemy (orm). From those queries I was then able to use pandas and matplotlib to make dataframes and graphic visualizations. Furthermore, I used Flask API to create and app that contains all the data through various endpoints. This also makes the data avaliable in a website format.

Some code that I used was sourced from these links

https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/date.html#sphx-glr-gallery-text-labels-and-annotations-date-py

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matplotlib-axis-axis-set_major_locator-function-in-python/

It was for plotting some things in matplotlib. The x-axis of date contain every single date for each x-tick. I wanted there to only be a couple of x-ticks so I used this code as reference to create that.
